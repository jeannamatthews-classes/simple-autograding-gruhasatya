# What is the difference between a text file and a markdown file?

## Text File (.txt)
- Contains plain text without any formatting.
- No syntax for structuring content (e.g., headings, bold, lists).
- Used for storing raw information, notes, or logs.

## Markdown File (.md)
- Allows for formatted text using simple syntax.
- Supports headings, lists, links, bold, italics, and more.
- Commonly used for documentation, README files, and static site generation.
