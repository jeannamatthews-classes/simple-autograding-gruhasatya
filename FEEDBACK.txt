Was any of this material about GitHub new to you? If so, what?

Yes, some aspects of GitHub were new to me. Specifically:
1. The ability to create a profile README to showcase personal projects and interests.
2. Experimenting with different features within a repository, such as creating issues, using GitHub Actions, and exploring project boards.
3. The distinction between different file formats, like text files and markdown files, and how markdown allows for formatted content while text files are plain.

These features provided a better understanding of how GitHub can be used not only for version control but also for project management and personal branding.
